# Foehammer's Tech-Terrarium

The objective of this repo is to create a full ecosystem of services that are either the tools, or representative of
tools in a tech stack in a small (ish) local environment for testing, learning, and development purposes.

There are some applications within this environment, we chose to implement them in Python for simplicity and speed to
deployment, but the idea is that any Python app here could be re-written in another language.
