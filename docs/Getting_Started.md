# Getting Started

TODO: write out with simple step-by-step instructions how to use the tech terrarium and get started with it.

- [ ] add a pre-reqs sections with instructions for setting up for usage
    - list out basic knowledge pre-reqs (git, docker, docker-compose, python (recomended), sql, etc.)
    - docker
    - docker-compose
    - make (optional, but recommended)
    - pre-commit (optional, but recommended if you plan to fork or contribute)
    - I use pycharm professional for everything, but it would be good to also set this up for easy integration with
      vs-code (would be good practice for me in general to get more familiar with vs-code)
- [ ] start off by having the user start the `admin` services and how to get to the `homepage`
    - review the admin "services" and how to set them up (if needed), and what their purpose is (making notes that most
      things aren't "necessary" but are tools that have made my life easier)
- [ ] have sections for each docker-compose "service" and how to start them
    - both makefile command references and general docker-compose commands (whatever people are comfortable with)
