# Spark

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system used for big data processing and analytics. It provides an
interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. It can handle both batch
and real-time analytics and data processing workloads.

Spark supports multiple programming languages such as Java, Python, and Scala and comes with built-in modules for SQL,
streaming, machine learning, and graph processing. It can be run on Hadoop, standalone, or in the cloud and can access
diverse data sources including HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, and S3.
