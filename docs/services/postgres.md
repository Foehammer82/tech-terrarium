# Postgres

Relational database that stores data in tables with rows and columns. It is used to store structured data and is
commonly used in enterprise applications.

Alternatives: MySQL, SQLite, Oracle

## As a Data Warehouse

In this project we are simulating a data warehouse using Postgres. In production, or the "real world", an actual data
warehouse would be used (i.e. Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, etc.). Data warehouses are used to store large amounts of
data from various sources and are optimized for read-heavy workloads.
