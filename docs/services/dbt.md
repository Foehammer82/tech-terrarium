# DBT

!!! note

    I can not recommend DBT enough. It's a fantastic tool for transforming data and creating data models. My only 
    wish is that I had used it sooner on previous projects that it was LITERALLY designed to solve.

Data transformation tool that is used for transforming data in the data warehouse. It is used for writing SQL queries
to transform data and create data models.

Alternatives: Apache Spark, Talend, Matillion
