### FastAPI Overview of "Concurency and async / await"

<a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/" target="_blank">https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/</a>

!!! note

    This is a great overview written in the FastAPI docs explaining the `async def` syntax for path operation 
    functions and some background about asynchronous code, concurrency, and parallelism.

### Big List of Links in no particular order

!!! abstract

    actually, one idea that might be worth poking at would be setting up a comment system or a way to submit links 
    that get would get sent to a queue (kafka topic, redis, rabbitmq, something...) and then use LLM's with web access 
    to summarize, categorize, tag, and then store to a database (or be sent to another queue for approval) and then
    diplay on a page or be the foundation of a link storing system. (might also be neat to have that create PR's against
    this very page)

    tl;dr: paste a link somewhere (or have a browser extension)

!!! question

    this whole page is actually a bit outside the scope of the terrarium project and would make more sense to be it's 
    own project and deployment.
